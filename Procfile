# Procfile for Heroku
# This file tells Heroku how to run your app
# With heroku.yml (Docker), this is optional but can be useful for worker processes

# Web process - runs the daemon
web: cd apps/agor-daemon && node dist/index.js

# Release phase - initialize database (optional, runs before deployment)
# release: cd apps/agor-daemon && node dist/index.js --init
